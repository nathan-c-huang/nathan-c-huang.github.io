Overview:
* Investigated the role of substrate temperature and deposition rate on incoherent twin boundary (ITB) mobility and migration behavior
* Performed kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of the 2-D (111) surface to simulate ITB migration during the deposition of Cu thin films
* Identified two types of close-packed ITBs with different mobilities depending on local atomic configurations

More details soon...
