Overview:
* Investigated the self-assembly of colloidal crystals under confinement compared to the bulk
* Performed hard-particle Monte Carlo simulations of systems of tetrahedra and octahedra nanoparticles in spherical and flat-wall containers at
* Demonstrated higher crystallinity and lower quantities of single-component phase defects in binary crystal assemblies formed under confinement
