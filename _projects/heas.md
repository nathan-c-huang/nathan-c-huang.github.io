Overview:
* Investigated the influence of atomic size distribution on the phase stability and crystal structure of high-entropy alloys
* Performed coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of multi-component systems
* Trained predictive SVR model for five-component HEA assemblies based on size dispersity and composition of constituent elements
