I am currently a LTD Dielectrics Module Engineer at Intel. 

I graduated with a M.Eng. and B.S. in Materials Science and Engineering from Cornell University, advised by <a href="https://www.mse.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/julia-dshemuchadse"> Julia Dshemuchadse</a>. As part of the <a href="https://capecrystal.mse.cornell.edu">CAPE CryStAL<a> research group, I investigated self-assembly kinetics and structure of monolayer materials, colloidal crystals, and high-entropy alloys using coarse-grained molecular dynamics and hard particle Monte Carlo simulations. 

I enjoy swimming and playing badminton. I also dabble in electronic music production.

More to come!
