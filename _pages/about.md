I am currently working at Intel as a process engineer.  

I graduated with a B.S. and M.Eng. in Materials Science and Engineering from Cornell University, advised by <a href="https://www.mse.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/julia-dshemuchadse"> Prof. Julia Dshemuchadse</a>. As part of the <a href="https://capecrystal.mse.cornell.edu">CAPE CryStAL<a> research group, I investigated self-assembly kinetics and structure of monolayer materials, colloidal crystals, and high-entropy alloys using coarse-grained molecular dynamics and hard particle Monte Carlo simulations. 

Outside of work, I enjoy reading, swimming and playing badminton. I also dabble in electronic music composition and production.

More to come!
